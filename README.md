[1] Preparation requires you to manually select a preparation playlist by right clicking on a playlist in the Traktor software.

### Jump Mode

Jump mode allows you to skip around the track using the pads. It also provides fine-tuned looping, allowing you to set the beginning and end of a loop. This means you can create loops of any beat size or even off the grid with snap turned off. If a loop is active, the jumping pads move the loop. Press "loop out" to exit the loop.

- PUSH SAMPLES for jump mode

Layout:

| -32 | loop in | loop out | 32 |
|:---:|:-------:|:--------:|:--:|
|  -8 |    -1   |     1    |  8 |

Layout (with SHIFT held):

| -16 | loop in | loop out | 16 |
|:---:|:-------:|:--------:|:--:|
|  -4 |    -1   |     1    |  4 |

### Loop Mode

Loop mode allows you to initiate loops using the pads. This works really well with FLUX enabled.

- PUSH STEMS for loop mode

Layout:

| 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/2 |  1 |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  4  |  8  |  16 | 32 |
